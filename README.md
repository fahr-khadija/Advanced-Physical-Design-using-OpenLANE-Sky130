# (***Advanced Physical Design using OpenLANE Sky130***)
# Detail Report of my 5 days workshop 
## In this workshop I will 

  * Design and characterize our own standard cell 
  * Have a hands-on in the Physical Design domain
  * Generate a full GDSII from a RTL netlist throut all PD flow steps 
  * Explore and contribute to open source EDA world

## Global Specifications 
   * ### Reference Design Base  *:RISC-V based PicoRV32 SoC*  
   * ### Platform labs          *:Remote access in the portal*
 * ### Technology               *:SkyWater 130nm process node*
 * ### Open source tools:
       
       * Yosys    – Synthesis
       * OpenLane - RTL2GDS
       * NgSpice  - Characterisation
       * Magic    – Layout and Floorplanning
       * OpenSTA  – Pre-layout and Post-layout Static timing analysis
